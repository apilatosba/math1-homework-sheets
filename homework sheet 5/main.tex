\section*{Problem 1(b)}
\section*{Problem 1(b)(i)}
We want to prove \(\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i\) is closed.\\
We are given (\(\forall i \in I \quad U_i \subseteq R\)) is closed. \\
A set being closed means that its complement is open. So we want to prove that \(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i^c\) is open.\\
Since each \(U_i\) is closed, we know that \(U_i^c\) is open.\\
And from the lecture we know that union or intersection of open sets is open. Thus \(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i^c\) is open. Which means that \(\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i\) is closed.\\
And this completes the proof.\\

\section*{Problem 1(b)(ii)}
We want to prove \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n U_i\) is closed.\\
We are given (\(U_1,...,U_n \subseteq R\)) are closed. \\
A set being closed means that its complement is open. So we want to prove that \(\bigcap_{i = 1}^n U_i^c\) is open.\\
Since each \(U_i\) is closed, we know that \(U_i^c\) is open.\\
And from the lecture we know that union or intersection of open sets is open. Thus \(\bigcap_{i = 1}^n U_i^c\) is open. Which means that \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n U_i\) is closed.\\
And this completes the proof.\\
