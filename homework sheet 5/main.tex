\section*{Problem 1}

\section*{Problem 1(b)}
\section*{Problem 1(b)(i)}
We want to prove \(\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i\) is closed.\\
We are given (\(\forall i \in I \quad U_i \subseteq R\)) is closed. \\
A set being closed means that its complement is open. So we want to prove that \(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i^c\) is open.\\
Since each \(U_i\) is closed, we know that \(U_i^c\) is open.\\
And from the lecture we know that union or intersection of open sets is open. Thus \(\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i^c\) is open. Which means that \(\bigcap_{i \in I} U_i\) is closed.\\
And this completes the proof.\\

\section*{Problem 1(b)(ii)}
We want to prove \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n U_i\) is closed.\\
We are given (\(U_1,...,U_n \subseteq R\)) are closed. \\
A set being closed means that its complement is open. So we want to prove that \(\bigcap_{i = 1}^n U_i^c\) is open.\\
Since each \(U_i\) is closed, we know that \(U_i^c\) is open.\\
And from the lecture we know that union or intersection of open sets is open. Thus \(\bigcap_{i = 1}^n U_i^c\) is open. Which means that \(\bigcup_{i = 1}^n U_i\) is closed.\\
And this completes the proof.\\

\section*{Problem 3}

\section*{Problem 3(a)}
\[
   a_n := (-1)^n
\]
\(a_n\) is not convergent. Because, for example, if we take \(\epsilon = 1/10\) then there is no N that satisfies
\[
   |a_N - a| < 1/10
\]
\(a_n\) alternates between -1 and 1. So we can't find a value \(a\) that stays in the neighborhood of both -1 and 1.
For example, when \(\epsilon = 1/10\) there is no \(a \in R\) that satisfies
\[
   |1 - a| < 1/10 \quad \text{and} \quad |-1 - a| < 1/10
\]
No matter what you choose N to be you will always get for some \(j \in N\) \(a_j = 1\) and \(a_j = -1\). \\
Thus \(a_n\) is divergent.\\
