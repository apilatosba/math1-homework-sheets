\section*{Problem 2}

\subsection*{(a)}

\(U_1\): \\
\(U_1\) is subspace of \(R[x]\). \\
\textbf{Not empty:} \\
\(U_1\) is not empty because \(0 \in U_1\) (zero polynomial). \\
\textbf{Closed under addition:} \\
Let \(p(x), q(x) \in U_1\). Then \(p(0) = 0\) and \(q(0) = 0\). \\
Then, \((p + q)(0) = p(0) + q(0) = 0 + 0 = 0\). \\
\textbf{Closed under scalar multiplication:} \\
Let \(p(x) \in U_1\) and \(c \in R\). Then, \((cp)(0) = c(p(0)) = c(0) = 0\). \\
Thus, \(U_1\) is closed under scalar multiplication. \\
\\
\(U_2\): \\
\(U_2\) is not a subspace of \(R[x]\). Because \(U_2\) doesn't contain the zero polynomial. (every vector space has to contain the zero vector which is the zero polynomial in this case) \\
\\
\(U_3\): \\
\(U_3\) is subspace of \(R[x]\). \\
\textbf{Not empty:} \\
\(U_3\) is not empty because \(0 \in U_3\) (zero polynomial). \\
\textbf{Closed under addition:} \\
Let \(p(x), q(x) \in U_3\). Then \(p(1) = 0\) and \(q(1) = 0\). \\
Then, \((p + q)(1) = p(1) + q(1) = 0 + 0 = 0\). \\
\textbf{Closed under scalar multiplication:} \\
Let \(p(x) \in U_3\) and \(c \in R\). Then, \((cp)(1) = c(p(1)) = c(0) = 0\). \\
Thus, \(U_3\) is closed under scalar multiplication. \\
\\
\(U_4\): \\
\(U_4\) is subspace of \(R[x]\). \\
\textbf{Not empty:} \\
\(U_4\) is not empty because \(0 \in U_4\) (zero polynomial). \\
\textbf{Closed under addition:} \\
Let \(p(x), q(x) \in U_4\). Then \(\int_0^1 p(x) dx = 0\) and \(\int_0^1 q(x) dx = 0\). \\
Then, \(\int_0^1 (p + q)(x) dx = \int_0^1 p(x) dx + \int_0^1 q(x) dx = 0 + 0 = 0\). \\
\textbf{Closed under scalar multiplication:} \\
Let \(p(x) \in U_4\) and \(c \in R\). Then, \(\int_0^1 (cp)(x) dx = c\int_0^1 p(x) dx = c(0) = 0\). \\
Thus, \(U_4\) is closed under scalar multiplication. \\
\\
\(U_5\): \\
\(U_5\) is subspace of \(R[x]\). \\
\textbf{Not empty:} \\
\(U_5\) is not empty because \(0 \in U_5\) (zero polynomial). \\
\textbf{Closed under addition:} \\
Let \(p(x), q(x) \in U_5\). Then \(p'(0) + p''(0) = 0\) and \(q'(0) + q''(0) = 0\). \\
Then, \((p + q)'(0) + (p + q)''(0) = p'(0) + q'(0) + p''(0) + q''(0) = 0 + 0 = 0\). \\
\textbf{Closed under scalar multiplication:} \\
Let \(p(x) \in U_5\) and \(c \in R\). Then, \((cp)'(0) + (cp)''(0) = c(p'(0)) + c(p''(0)) = c(p'(0) + p''(0)) = c(0) = 0\). \\
Thus, \(U_5\) is closed under scalar multiplication. \\
\\
\(U_6\): \\
\(U_6\) is not a subspace of \(R[x]\). Becuase it is not closed under addition \\
Let \(p(x), q(x) \in U_6\). Then \(p'(0)p''(0) = 0\) and \(q'(0)q''(0) = 0\). \\
Then, \((p + q)'(0)(p + q)''(0) = (p'(0) + q'(0)) (p''(0) + q''(0)) = p'(0)p''(0) + p'(0)q''(0) + q'(0)p''(0) + q'(0)q''(0) = p'(0)q''(0) + q'(0)p''(0)\) \\
Which is not necessarily equal to 0. Thus \(U_6\) is not closed under addition. \\
